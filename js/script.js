  console.log(i);
}

// Question 2 Write a loop that logs the numbers 10 to 1. Count down from 10 to 1.

for (var i = 10; i >= 1; i--) {
    console.log(i);
  }

// Question 3 Write a loop that counts from 10 to 20, and log only the odd numbers. 11, 13, 15, etc

for (var a = 11; a <= 20; a+=2) {
    console.log(a);
